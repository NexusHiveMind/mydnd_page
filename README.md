# mydnd_page
The idea is to create a character creator page for players to  create and save their own characters, hosted by myself. It will be a mix of D&D and Pathfinder 2e, where it has the 3 action economy, the spells, the weapons and armor (mid armor stronger) of pathfinder but it has the freedom of D&D (not so tough restrictions in the feat aquiring part, if you have sand in your pocket you can use an action to throw it, you don't need the feat for it).
