# mydnd_page
The idea is to create a character creator page for players to  create and save their own characters, hosted by myself. It will be a mix of D&D and Pathfinder 2e, where it has the 3 action economy, the spells, the weapons and armor (mid armor stronger) of pathfinder but it has the freedom of D&D (not so tough restrictions in the feat aquiring part, if you have sand in your pocket you can use an action to throw it, you don't need the feat for it).

Other notes about the system will be made on this document as it develops:
+Implement the flat footed condition.

+Thematic differences with D&D:
    -No dark Vision Races.
    -No half-races.
    -3 Actions and a reaction from pathfinder 2e replace Action (2 actions) and movement/bonus action (1 action) and a reaction from 5e.
    -Concentration demands you spend 1 Action point every turn to maintain the spell
    -Advantage/Disadvantage Rare (it is a difference of +5 statistically)

+DYING
    -Use the exhaustion new rule of One D&D (-1 to all D20 rolls and -1 to their Spell Save DC for each level of exhaustion), but tie it with the wound condition for pathfinder (old rules, not new ones).
    -If at 0 hit points you gain the Semi-Conscious and Dying 0 (+your exhaustion level) conditions.
    -Semi-Conscious condition: you get 1 action or reaction per turn and you are flat-footed.
    -Dying condition: if you get to Dying 4 you die.
    -Every time you take damage you increase your Dying condition by 1.

+Crits:
    Over +10 or under -10 to DC is a critical Success or Failure, 20 and ones lower the success by 1 tier

+Spellcasting
    -Can Cast Spells up to half of its level

+Armor:
    -Resistance (Damage that it can absorb)
    -Min STR
    -AC Provided

+Character Customization:
    -Hard Proficiencies (Languages, Armor, Type of Weapon, Tool)
    -Skills (Awareness, Reaction Time, Athletics, Survival, Feet work, Hand Finesse, Investigation, Lore, Influence, Performance)
    -Combat Tactics
    -Talents
    -Spells

+Character Progression:
    -10 Levels (each level 10XP)
    -Re-Training: an Activity in Downtime that allows you to change a Combat tactic for another, craft, or try yo learn a spell.

+Rest:
    -Short rest: 4 hs (Regenerate Life and partial resources, keeps Exhaustion at bay from traveling)
    -Long rest: 12 hs (Regenerate full Life and resources, lowers exhaustion in 1)
    -Downtime day: 24 hs (Regenerate full life and resources, lowers exhaustion in 1, can do a downtime activity)

+Downtime Activities:
    -Re-train
    -Craft
    -Learn a Spell
