# mydnd_page
The idea is to create a character creator page for players to  create and save their own characters, hosted by myself. It will be a mix of D&D and Pathfinder 2e, where it has the 3 action economy, the spells, the weapons and armor (mid armor stronger) of pathfinder but it has the freedom of D&D (not so tough restrictions in the feat aquiring part, if you have sand in your pocket you can use an action to throw it, you don't need the feat for it).

Other notes about the system will be made on this document as it develops:
-Implement the flat footed condition.

+DYING
    -Use the exhaustion new rule of One D&D (-1 to all D20 rolls and -1 to their Spell Save DC for each level of exhaustion), but tie it with the wound condition for pathfinder (old rules, not new ones).
    -If at 0 hit points you gain the semi-concious and dying 0 (+your exhaustion level) conditions.
    -Semi-Concious condition: you get 1 action or reaction per turn and you are flat-footed.
    -Dying condition: if you get to Dying 4 you die.
    -Every time you take damage you increase your Dying condition by 1.
